## Hi there 👋
I'm Yanelly Hernandez, I am a Data Scientist in North California.

## About me:
I’m passionate about leveraging data to drive informed decisions and develop innovative solutions. With a Bachelor's degree in Applied Mathematical Sciences, my academic journey has shown me the strong connection between mathematics and real-world applications. My fascination with data analytics grew during my undergraduate studies, where I explored courses in statistical methods, probability, numerical methods, and computational techniques.

One of the highlights of my academic experience was using mathematics to model real-world problems across various domains. Additionally, I completed Coursera's Google Data Analytics course, which further fueled my passion for analytics. Through that course, I honed my skills in manipulating large datasets, identifying patterns, and extracting meaningful insights.

I am expanding my expertise by completing a Data Science Professional Certificate at LearningFuze, which I will finish in October 2024. This program has deepened my passion for data analytics and data science. I am eager to apply this knowledge to solve complex problems and contribute to impactful projects.

## Table of Contents:
1. [ds-m1-0424-code-solutions](https://github.com/yhernandez55/ds-m1-0424-code-solutions)
This repository contains Python and SQL mini assignments that I completed during my LearningFuze boot camp. Each branch is a mini-assignment that I have completed with data that was used for the assignment. 
2. [Regression-Analysis--Home-Prices](https://github.com/yhernandez55/Regression-Analysis--Home-Prices)
The repository contains the first big project that I have worked on to predict house sale prices using machine learning techniques. In this project I compared models such as Linear Regression, Neural Networks, and XGBOOST for model performance.
