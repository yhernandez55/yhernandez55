## Hi there üëã
I'm Yanelly Hernandez, I am a Data Scientist in Northern California.

## About me:
I am passionate about leveraging data to drive informed decisions and develop innovative solutions. With a Bachelor's degree in Applied Mathematical Sciences, my academic journey has highlighted the strong connection between mathematics and real-world applications. My fascination with data analytics began during my undergraduate studies, where I delved into courses on statistical methods, probability, numerical methods, and computational techniques. Additionally, I hold a Data Science Professional Certificate issued by LearningFuze, which has further deepened my passion for data analytics and data science. I am eager to apply this knowledge to solve complex problems and contribute to impactful projects. A highlight of my academic experience was using mathematics to model real-world problems across various domains.

## Table of Contents:
1. [ds-m1-0424-code-solutions](https://github.com/yhernandez55/ds-m1-0424-code-solutions)
This repository contains Python and SQL mini-assignments completed during my first module at the LearningFuze immersive program. Each branch corresponds to a specific mini-assignment and dataset provided by the program, focusing on enhancing skills in Python scripting and SQL querying.

3. [ds-m2-0424-code-solutions](https://github.com/yhernandez55/ds-m2-0424-code-solutions)
This repository continues from Module 1, covering more advanced topics in Python, including deeper data analysis techniques.

5. [Regression-Analysis--Home-Prices](https://github.com/yhernandez55/Regression-Analysis--Home-Prices)
My first major project, aimed at predicting house sale prices using machine learning techniques. I compared models such as Linear Regression, Neural Networks, and XGBOOST to evaluate performance. The dataset used comes from Kaggle's House Prices - Advanced Regression Techniques competition. This repository includes:
  - Model notebook
  - Extended Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
  - Submissions for the Three Models
  - Preprocessing functions

7. [Home_Credit_Default_Risk-Classification](https://github.com/yhernandez55/Home_Credit_Default_Risk-Classification)
My second major project focused on predicting loan repayment probability. I compared Neural Networks and XGBOOST models, fine-tuning parameters for optimal accuracy. The dataset comes from Kaggle‚Äôs Home Credit Default Risk competition. This repository includes:
  - Model Notebook
  - Extended EDA
  - Model Submission
  - Preprocessing Functions

9. [Streamlit_Projects](https://github.com/yhernandez55/Streamlit_Projects)
A collection of three interactive mini-projects built with Streamlit:
  - Spam Message Detection: Classifies SMS messages as spam or not.
  - Flight Price Prediction: Uses demographic and flight-related data to predict ticket prices.
  - Wine Review Sentiment Analysis: Classifies wine reviews as positive or negative based on text and ratings.

10. [nyc-motor-vehicle-collisions](https://github.com/yhernandez55/nyc-motor-vehicle-collisions)
This project analyzes motor vehicle collisions in New York City using data from NYC OpenData to identify trends, contributing factors, and accident patterns. The goal is to provide data-driven insights and recommendations for improving road safety.
  Key Highlights:
     - Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Identified trends in accident frequency, locations, and causes.
     - Data Visualization: Created interactive charts and geospatial visualizations to illustrate accident hotspots.
     - Insights & Recommendations: Propose steps to enhance road safety, especially for vulnerable users.
     - Final Deliverable: Developed a virtual poster presentation summarizing the findings and policy recommendations.
This project showcases my skills in data analysis, visualization, and storytelling, reinforcing my ability to translate raw data into actionable insights.

11. [gemini-sql-data-assistant](https://github.com/yhernandez55/gemini-sql-data-assistant)
This project leverages Google Cloud‚Äôs Gemini API to build an AI-powered assistant that helps users explore datasets through natural language questions. The tool translates questions into SQL queries and explains results in plain English. It supports CSV uploads or defaults to a built-in dataset, and runs on both Kaggle and local environments.
Key Highlights:
  - AI Integration: Used Google Gemini to generate SQL from user input.
  - Interactive Design: Created a loop for dynamic, chat-style data exploration.
  - Data Flexibility: Supports both Kaggle datasets and user-uploaded CSVs.
  - Final Deliverable: A notebook-based assistant showcasing GenAI in real-world data workflows.

12. [image-retrieval](https://github.com/yhernandez55/image-retrieval)
This project performs image retrieval and classification on 101 categories from the Caltech101 dataset. A ResNet50 convolutional neural network was used for feature extraction, chosen for its superior performance compared to ResNet18 and ResNet34. The project uses metric learning techniques to generate image embedding vectors, allowing efficient similarity-based retrieval. This repository includes:
- A notebook containing the training and evaluation pipeline (including Precision@k, Recall@k, and F1@k where k=1)
- The Caltech101 dataset
- A Streamlit-based interactive app that allows users to upload an image and retrieve visually similar images from the dataset
